                    Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson (Icelandic pronunciation: ​[ˈcɪlvɪ ˈθou:r̥ ˈsɪ:ɣʏrðsɔn]; born 8 September 1989) is an Icelandic professional
                    footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Swansea City. He is a specialist on set-pieces
                    and possesses great long-range shooting ability.

                    He began his professional career with Reading in the Championship, and in 2010 was sold to Hoffenheim in Reading's biggest
                    sale. He was voted Player of the Season for two consecutive seasons — for Reading in 2009–10 and for
                    Hoffenheim in 2010–11. After a season back in English football with Swansea he joined Tottenham Hotspur
                    for £8.8 million, and in 2014 moved back to Swansea as part of an exchange for Ben Davies.

                    Gylfi made his senior international debut for Iceland in 2010 and has since earned over 40 caps. He represented Iceland at
                    their first major tournament, UEFA Euro 2016, where the Nordic country reached the quarter-final.
