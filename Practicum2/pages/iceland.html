                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Iceland men's national football team (Icelandic: Íslenska karlalandsliðið í knattspyrnu) is the national men's football
                            team of Iceland and is controlled by the Football Association of Iceland.
                        </p>
                        <h3>First major tournament</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although Iceland is one of Europe's smaller football nations, the football team has enjoyed success in the 21st century.
                            In the qualifying rounds for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Iceland reached the play offs before losing
                            to Croatia. Iceland reached its first major tournament, UEFA Euro 2016, after a qualification
                            campaign which included home and away wins over the Netherlands.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Summary EURO 2016</h3>
                        <p>
                            In doing so, they became the smallest ever nation to qualify for a major tournament. Iceland was allocated to Euro 2016 Group
                            F. Birkir Bjarnason scored Iceland's first major tournament goal in the 50th minute against Portugal
                            in a group stage match. After advancing to the knockout stages of Euro 2016, Iceland defeated
                            England in the Round of 16, advancing to the quarter-finals, where they lost to France 5–2. Iceland
                            finished eighth in the tournament, with two wins, two draws and one defeat.

                    <h2>Going Icelandic</h2>
                    <article>
                        <h3>Early days</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gylfi took part in the 2008 U19 European Championship qualifying, scoring twice in qualification and twice in the elite round,
                            but Iceland lost out to group winners Bulgaria by three points and missed out on the finals.
                            In November 2007, Gylfi made his U21 debut for Iceland, playing half an hour against Germany
                            in a 3–0 loss. He made his first appearance in the 2009 European Under-21 Championship qualifying
                            four days later, coming as an extra-time substitute, and played in the remaining matches. In
                            Iceland's last match, he scored the opener against Slovakia but Miroslav Stoch equalised to make
                            it 1–1. Iceland failed to qualify for the play-offs but made a bright start to the 2011 campaign.
                            He made his campaign debut in October against San Marino, scoring a brace within 16 minutes in
                            a 6–0 thrashing.

                            In May 2010, Gylfi made his full Iceland debut in a convincing 4–0 win over Andorra and provided the assist for the second
                            goal from a free kick. Gylfi also helped Iceland's U21 side reach the 2011 UEFA European Under-21
                            Championship, playing in both play-off legs against Scotland U21s as Iceland won 4–2 on aggregate.
                            In the second leg, Gylfi scored two second-half goals to ensure Iceland won the match 2–1.

                            2016 qualifying match. In the reverse fixture the following 3 September at the Amsterdam Arena,
                            he converted another spot-kick for the only goal of the game, after Gregory van der Wiel had
                            fouled Birkir Bjarnason.
                        </p>
                        <h3>EURO 2016</h3>
                        <p>
                            He was selected for UEFA Euro 2016. On 18 June 2016, Gylfi scored Iceland's opening goal in the national side's second group
                            match against Hungary, which ended in a 1–1 draw.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Biggest EURO 2016 upset</h3>
