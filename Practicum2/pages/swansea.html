                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Swansea City Association Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Dinas Abertawe) is a Welsh professional football club based
                    in Swansea, Wales, that plays in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Swansea City represent
                    England when playing in European competitions, although they have represented Wales in the past. The
                    club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and joined the Football League in 1921. The club changed their
                    name in 1969, when they adopted the name Swansea City to reflect Swansea's new status as a city. Swansea
                    have played their home matches at the Liberty Stadium since 2005, having previously played at the Vetch
                    Field since the club was founded.

                    In 1981, the club was promoted to the original Football League First Division. It was during the following season they came
                    close to winning the league title, but a decline then set near the season's end before finishing sixth,
                    although a club record. It was from here the club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to
                    the Football League Fourth Division a few seasons later, then narrowly avoided relegation to the Football
                    Conference in 2003. The Swansea City Supporters Society Ltd owns 20% of the club, with their involvement
                    hailed by Supporters Direct as "the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters' trust
                    in the direct running of a club". The club's subsequent climb from the fourth division of English football
                    to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, Jack to a King – The Swansea Story.

            <h2>Gylfi at Swansea</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Early days</h3>
                <p>
                    In July 2014, Tottenham announced that a deal had been reached with Swansea City for Gylfi to re-join his former club, while
                    Swansea left-back Ben Davies would join Spurs. On the move, Gylfi said, "I really enjoyed my time here
                    last time. I know the club, I know the manager, I know the players and I obviously know the fans and
                    the city as well, so that wasn't that difficult for me." In the opening match of the 2014–15 season,
                    he set up the opener and scored the winning goal as Swansea defeated Manchester United 2–1 at Old Trafford,
                    making this the first time the Red Devils have lost their opening home game since 1972. Gylfi continued
                    his good start to his Swansea return with another 3 assists in his next 2 games. In a home game against
                    Arsenal on 9 November 2014, Gylfi curled a free kick over the wall and into the corner of the net from
                    25 yards to equalise in a 2–1 win. Gylfi scored in a 4–1 away defeat against Liverpool at Anfield on
                    29 December.

                <h3>Growing as a star</h3>
                <p>
                    On 17 January 2015, a wayward pass by Gylfi allowed Chelsea's Oscar to score after 50 seconds in an eventual 5–0 home defeat
                    for Swansea. A week later, he scored and was sent off in added time at the end of a 3–1 defeat away to
                    Blackburn Rovers in an FA Cup Fourth Round tie, with Swansea already having been down to ten men after
                    the earlier dismissal of Kyle Bartley.

                    Amidst rumours of a £25 million move to Everton, he signed a new four-year deal on 2 August 2016. Gylfi scored his first
                    goal of the 2016–17 season on 11 September against Chelsea with a second-half penalty in a game which
                    finished 2–2.
